# WordGame
House rules that can be implemented for a word scoring game.  
Words have a score based on letter value, length of word, and frequency of word seen.  
The frequency of the word is calculated using a hash table.
I coded the hash table to use double hashing as its collision resolution technique.

The input files (game0.txt, game1.txt, etc.) contain words that test the output of the program.
